# Security and Code Review Summary: Log Monitoring Application

See the main README.md for a summary and RELEASE_NOTES.md for release history.

## Secure Coding Practices
- Input validation and error handling for log parsing and file operations
- Logging of malformed or unrecognized data
- Use of context managers for file I/O
- CLI argument parsing with argparse
- Output file writing with error handling
- Unit tests for normal, edge, and error cases

## Code Quality Practices
- Modular code structure (log_parser, report_generator, main)
- Docstrings and comments for complex logic
- PEP8 style and type hints
- Automated tests for all major features

## Recommendations
- Further input sanitization for user-uploaded logs
- Consider log rotation/streaming for large files
- See `USER_GUIDE.md` for usage and troubleshooting
